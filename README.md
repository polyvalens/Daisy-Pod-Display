# Daisy Pod Display
Arduino-based display for the [Daisy Pod](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/pod) controlled by the pod's RGB LEDs. Supposing the application running on the Daisy uses the pod's RGB LEDs for status indication, this sketch lets you attach human-readable text to it displayed on an alphanumerical LCD.
